# Toronto Housing Prices Project

## Question: Why are houses so expensive in Toronto?
There has been a lot of public debate
recently about housing prices in Toronto. The cost of living is becoming unaffordable for
many Torontonians and home ownership has become unfeasible for a growing
percentage of the population. There have been lots of explanations offered and
solutions presented from across the political spectrum, yet the data underlying many of
these arguments seems surprisingly scarce and the arguments surprisingly
non-quantitative. Using any means accessible to you as a private citizen, and any data
available that you deem relevant, can you propose what you think is the most important
cause of high prices (e.g. lack of supply, lending policy, speculation/foreign ownership,
tax policy etc.). Based on this, what are one or two policy proposals that are most likely
to reduce housing prices by the largest magnitude? (Note: Donâ€™t worry about potential
adverse side effects of such proposals. The goal of the exercise is to come up with a
good simplified model of the housing market, not to come up with policy proposals you
would necessarily vote for.).<br>
<br>
To start answering this question, first we need to determine what parameters affect housing prices in Toronto.<br>
<br>
A study by Royal Bank of Canada and the Pambia Institute indicated following parameters affect housing prices in Toronto:
<br>
* Real income and demographics
* The cost and accessibility of mortgages
* Construction and development costs
* Land availability and regulations
* Location and housing stock supply and demand

<br>
Data from different sources (cited at the end) where gathered and compiled to take these factors into account in this anaysis:
<br>
* Monthly Home Transactions: database containing monthly house sales information.
* Ontario Employment Wages: Monthly wages across Ontario.
* Land Pricing Index: Land price index in Toronto.
* Mortgage Rates: prime and mortgage retes.
* Average Residential Building Construction Price Index: an indec showing residential building costs in Toronto.<br>
<br>

In addition, a sixth parameter; total jobs in city of Toronto is also included.

### Based on data availability, monthly data for an 11 years window from January 2011 to December 2021 is considered in this analysis.

The structure of this report is as follow:<br>
